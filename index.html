                    <p>
                        I am a Computer Scientist with a passion for programming and problem solving. I am working to achieve a Bachelor of Arts in computer science at the University of Otago. <br><br>

                        My interests include creative programming where i can put my musical and artistic talents to use. Naturally that means I am intested in game development and web design. 
                        I have been a game development hobbyist for many years and have created many small games, projects, and prototypes. My go to IDE for game development is Gamemaker.
                        Aside from Game development I enjoy front-end development and crafting high quality places to be. Creating detailed designs for my projects is usually a highlight of the production for me.<br><br>

                        I am also a musician and have been playing guitar for many years. While not a social player, I enjoy playing loud metal riffage in my bedroom. I also have had a go at production with a digital audio workspace called Reaper. <br><br>

                <p>
                    I value trust, honesty, and forgiveness. <br><br>

                    I value my trust in others and their trust in meâ€”trust in work, ethics, and quality. <br><br>

                    I value honesty, both in myself and in others. We must be truthful when trust has been broken, whether by us or against us. <br><br>

                    I believe in forgiveness. We must forgive the mistakes of others because we are all human. <br><br>
