            <h2>Gamemaker 2 Raycaster</h2>
            <p>Being as interested in gaming history as I am it is no suprise that I am endlessly facinated by tech that was developed into products in the early 90's. 
               I have always wanted to implement these concepts to further understand how they work. The ultimate goal would be to implement a rendered like DOOM. However, lets not get ahead of ourselves.

                <br><br>
                Before ID Software created DOOM, they created Wolfenstein 3D. One of the first first person shooters, and an important stepping stone towards development of the legendary DOOM.

                <br><br>
                Wolfenstein 3D used a technique called raycasting to render its 3D world. Raycasting is a technique that simulates the way light travels in a scene, allowing for the creation of 3D environments using 2D graphics.
                <br><br>
                Following a C tutorial by 3DSage (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYRrGTC7GtA), I have implemented a basic raycaster in Gamemaker 2. Please enjoy adding walls to the map on the left, and pointing at them on the right.
